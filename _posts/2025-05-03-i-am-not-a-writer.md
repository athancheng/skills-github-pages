# I Am Not a Writer
## Until I Write.

That's the idea. Some time during college, I resolved never to claim an identity until I can actively, tangibly live it. If I want to be a writer, then I can't be simply thinking about it. I have to *do* it.

The reason I point this out is because I've had a long history of procrastination and inaction. I just think it's a nice little mantra to keep in my head to get me on my feet at times.

Now, I don't think a simple sentence is going to solve all these problems, but if we're talking about things that float around in my head, this has got to be more preferable than others. I have plenty of thoughts about how to fight procrastination, but I'll shelve that for now (ironically), because this post is not about procrastination. It's about writing.

## What makes me a writer?
